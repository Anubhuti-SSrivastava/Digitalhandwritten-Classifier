# Digitalhandwritten-Classifier
A standard benchmark for neural network classification is the MNIST digits dataset, a set of 70,000 28×28 images of hand-written digits. Each MNIST digit is labeled with the correct digit class (0, 1, ... 9).
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training cases and 10,000 test cases of handwritten digits (0 to 9). Each digit is normalized and centered in a gray-scale (0 - 255) image with size 28 × 28. Each image consists of 784 pixels that represent the features of the digits.
Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer to recognize the human handwritten digits from different sources like images, papers, touch screens, etc, and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0-9). This has been a topic of boundless-research in the field of deep learning.
The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
